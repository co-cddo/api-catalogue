# Getting started

## About this project

The API catalogue is built with [Middleman][middleman], a static-site generator.

Pages describing the APIs are dynamically generated from the following CSV files:

- `data/organisation.csv` details the Organisations / Departments
- `data/catalogue.csv` details the APIs

Content for other pages is based on Markdown files located in the `source`
directory.

## Before you start

- [Setup rbenv][setup-rbenv] and install the Ruby version specified in [`.ruby-version`][ruby-version]
- [Setup Node][setup-node]

## Local setup

1. Clone the git repository: `git clone git@github.com:co-cddo/api-catalogue.git`
1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd api-catalogue`
1. Install gems: `bundle install`
1. Install JavaScript dependencies: `npm install`
1. Run the test suite to verify your setup: `bundle exec rspec`

## Docker setup

If you have Docker available on your machine, and would prefer not to setup the
project dependencies locally, you can run:

```
bin/docker_serve
```

By default this will build and serve the site on host port 4567. You can
navigate to `http://localhost:4567` to view the site.

## Preview your changes locally

To preview the API catalogue locally run:

```sh
bundle exec middleman server
```

See the generated website on `http://localhost:4567` in your browser. Any
content changes you make to the website will be updated in real time.

To shut down the Middleman instance running on your machine, use `ctrl+C`.

## Build

To build the static website run:

```sh
bundle exec middleman build
```

If the build fails, run it again with the `--verbose` flag to get detailed error
messages to help with finding the problem.

## Publishing

[Create a pull request][pull-request] to make changes to the site. When the pull
request is merged it'll be published automatically. See the
[deployment documentation][deployment] for further details.
