## Description:
The Document Checking Service (DCS) pilot is for non-public sector organisations that want to find out if British passports are valid. The DCS acts as an interface between a service and HM Passport Office. Your service sends a passport check request to the DCS. The DCS validates the request and sends it to HM Passport Office. HM Passport Office checks the passport data against their database and sends a response back to the DCS. The DCS sends the response to your service as outlined in check if a passport is valid.
