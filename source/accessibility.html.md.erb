# Accessibility statement for the UK Government API Catalogue

This accessibility statement applies to the UK Government API Catalogue at [https://alphagov.github.io/api-catalogue/#uk-government-apis](https://alphagov.github.io/api-catalogue/#uk-government-apis).

This website is run by the Data Standards Authority team at the Government Digital Service (GDS). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

+ change colours, contrast levels and fonts
+ zoom in up to 300% without problems
+ navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
+ navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
+ listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## How accessible this website is

We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible for the following reasons:

- one page has a redundant link
- there are issues caused by our Technical Documentation Template

## Feedback and contact information

If you need any part of this service in a different format like large print, audio recording or braille, email [api-standards-request@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:api-standards-request@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

## Enforcement procedure

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018
(the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, [contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/).

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

GDS is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

## Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

### Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

#### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

The [GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS) page](https://alphagov.github.io/api-catalogue/central/gds/paas/#gov-uk-platform-as-a-service-paas) has a redundant link. This is not a fail, but should be changed under [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-refs.html).

Also, some parts of this website are not fully accessible because of [issues caused by our Technical Documentation Template](https://tdt-documentation.london.cloudapps.digital/accessibility/#using-the-technical-documentation-template-for-your-own-documentation).

## How we tested this website

We last tested this website for accessibility issues in September 2020.

We used manual and automated tests to look for issues such as:

- lack of keyboard accessibility
- link text that’s not descriptive
- non-unique or non-hierarchical headings
- italics, bold and block capital formatting
- inaccessible formatting in general
- inaccessible language
- inaccessible diagrams or images
- lack of colour contrast for text, important graphics and controls
- images not having meaningful alt text
- problems when using assistive technologies such as screen readers and screen magnifiers

## What we’re doing to improve accessibility

We plan to change the redundant links and fix the accessibility issues with the Technical Documentation Template by the end of 2020.

This website was last tested in September 2020. The test was carried out by the technical writing team at GDS. We used the [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) and a checklist we created with the help of the GDS accessibility team. We tested all the website's pages.
