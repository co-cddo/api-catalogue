## Description:
The information contained within an event is recorded within clinical interventions or occurrences that happen throughout a clinical pathway or patient journey. These clinical interventions or occurrences are referenced throughout the Healthy Child Record Standard and are classed as a form of clinical contact either as part of the Healthy Child Programme <https://theprsb.org/standards/healthychildrecord/> as a planned intervention as part of the pathway, or unplanned contact such as a visit to a GP or Emergency Department. To ensure the aims of this strategy are met and small manageable segments of data are interoperable, the events catalogue breaks up the much larger clinical interventions/occurrences into smaller, more manageable 'events' to inform the data item requirements for each child health event message.
