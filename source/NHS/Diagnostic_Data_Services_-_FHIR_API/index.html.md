## Description:
The National Information Board (NIB)'s roadmap published in September 2015 Work_Stream_2.1_Final.pdf cited the National Laboratory Medicine Catalogue (NLMC) as one of the highest priority national information standards to complete and use within the next 1-3 years. The NLMC is thus planned to replace the current primary care pathology data standard, the Pathology Bounded Code List (PBCL). PBCL is a subset within the Read V2 terminology, and Read V2 is being nationally withdrawn in 2017. The NLMC will also address current gap areas in PBCL, including setting data standards for use across all care settings, for all pathology disciplines (e.g. including microbiology, histopathology, cytology, genetics and blood transfusion), for reporting, and including fully-approved standard units of measure per quantitative test. The NLMC is currently planned to adopt international technical standards wherever fit for purpose, including SNOMED CT, LOINC and UCUM.-n-nThe move to adopting the NLMC as a single set of pathology data standards for use across all care settings, addressing current content gaps and standardising pathology data across care settings requires the current national primary care pathology report message (profiled in EDIFACT) to be replaced to facilitate this change.
