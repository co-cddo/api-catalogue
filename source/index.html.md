# UK public sector APIs

This catalogue is for APIs published by public sector organisations in the UK.

Collecting a list of government APIs helps us understand:

* what APIs are published
* where API development is taking place
* whether APIs are suitable for reuse

The API catalogue also helps users across government find and access inter-departmental data exchanges, as well as sharing best practice in API development.

All of the APIs and data sources published in the catalogue have their own licensing and access restrictions. Check the documentation for each individual API for more details.

**Note**: An API appearing on this catalogue does not mean it will be publicly accessible, nor is it a requirement. This is a public-facing site to allow us to document and discover APIs that are available and in use.

The API Catalogue is a central part of the [Data Standards Authority's](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/data-standards-authority) API programme, which aims to improve how APIs are produced, managed and used across government.
