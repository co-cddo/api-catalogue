This protocol is capable of being used directly where user systems wish to bypass the MESH client or where they want to construct their own clients.\n\nThus the MESH service will become a direct 'store and retrieve' messaging mechanism between endpoints as a new asynchronous pattern for Spine consumers.\n\nMESH uses a RESTful paradigm and thus messages which are send via mesh are POSTed to a MESH virtual outbox and recipients retrieve messages through a GET to their virtual inbox.\n\nPlease note that the Production Server listed in the Console of this Apiary page refers to NHS Digital's Solution Assurance Integration test environment and not Live.

The NHS England Target Architecture also states that platforms moving forward will be expected to use common national services, standards, and governance processes to ensure national cohesion, including the NRL.\n\nMore information can be found at the NHS England page on Interoperability.\n\nIn 2016, NHS Digital concluded a proof of concept project to test the implementation challenges of the NRL and to measure its potential service impact and benefits. A decision was made to continue with the development of the NRL in four key regions across the NHS identified for their digital maturity as outlined below.\n\nWorking initially with urgent and emergency care, the NRL will enable cross border, cross organisation and cross sector interoperability. Our plan therefore is to integrate with:\n\n- North West, North East, Yorkshire, and London Ambulance Services and Mental Health Trusts\n- The Lancashire Patient Record Exchange Service\n- Cheshire Care Record\n\nProving the success of such integrations in Phase 1 will allow all records held within local shared records to be accessible via NRL in Phase 2 and beyond.",https://developer.nhs.uk/apis\nrl/,,,,,,national-health-service

This need stems from a strategic requirement to improve patient journeys and system efficiency. Therefore there is a need for a national standard that sets out what appointment booking solutions should and should not be able to do.\n\nUrgent and Emergency Care (UEC) has always been provided locally and things like the ability to book appointments and transfer care were dealt with locally or internally within a service, meaning they were often done using the same IT system. Local evolution of care systems gave rise to a largely heterogeneous IT infrastructure across the country.\n\nThe heterogeneous IT infrastructure is a blocker to directly booking appointments and transferring patient care between services and as such a capability gap exists.\n\nSome proprietary solutions have been created to provide a tactical solution for appointment booking interoperability between services. Nevertheless, there is a common list of issues and gaps that system suppliers and service providers have identified around these solutions.\n\nThe biggest gaps are currently:\n\n- a lack of clearly defined appointment booking workflow that can be applied consistently across all services\n\n- a lack of an appointment registry / index that allows services to easily find out if a patient already has an appointment booked\n\n- a lack of business rules around how appointment booking should be handled when happening across regional borders (introduces financial, political, and accountability challenges).\n\nSystem suppliers and service providers alike have asked for standardisation of the appointment booking technical specification and workflow in urgent care.",https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/uec-appointments/,,,,,,national-health-service

It records tidal elevations at 44 locations around the UK coast. Data is made available in near real-time with measurements reported every 15 mins. The measurements provide mean sea level within each 15 min window and are reported both relative to local datum (unit m) and relative to the Ordnance Datum at Newlyn (unit mAOD).\n\nThe Tide Gauge API provides access to these measurements, and to information on the monitoring stations providing those measurements. It is compatible with (and integrated into) the API for water level/flow and rainfall readings. The API data is normally updated every 15 mins so typically the latest available reading will lag between 15 and 30 mins.\n\nNote that all times given by the API are in GMT (also known as UTC), as indicated by the Z suffix (see XML Schema datatypes).\n\nThese APIs are provided as open data under the Open Government Licence with no requirement for registration.

The API provides access to these asset description records along with information on maintenance activities planned for the assets. Only some assets have an associated maintenance schedule.\n\nIn the API the maintenance information is split in to three different types. Maintenance activities represent funded and scheduled work. A single activity may involve several maintenance actions on several different assets. We divide the activities into separate tasks, where each task represents a specific maintenance action on a single asset. Finally maintenance plans represent intended maintenance activities for future financial years but which have not necessarily been scheduled or funded at this stage. The API allows all activities, tasks and plans to be listed for a particular asset, set of assets or across all assets.\n\nPlease visit the [Defra Data Services Forum](https://support.environment.data.gov.uk/hc/en-gb) to let us know about any issues or to ask questions.",https://environment.data.gov.uk/asset-management/doc/reference,,,,,,environment-agency

It lists preferential measures where the UK has entered into a new trade agreement or arrangement with a third country or territory.

This table (one of 3 available) shows all of the commodities that are part of the UK's goods classification and their English descriptions.\n\n Codes are organised in a hierarchy with each ""parent"" code having zero or more ""child"" codes that represent a more specific classification of the parent commodity. \n\nCommodities at all depths of the commodity hierarchy are included, but only commodities without any children codes are declarable. The current parent code of each commodity code is also listed and is accurate at the time the file was generated – note that parent codes can change over time. \n\nThe tariffs in this dataset may be a representation of future events and as such are subject to change. \n\nYou can use this data when you need to make a calculation against the new duties that apply in the UK.
