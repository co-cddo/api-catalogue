It lists preferential measures where the UK has entered into a new trade agreement or arrangement with a third country or territory.

Use this integration to support transfer of care from hospital to social services for patients with care and support needs, as described in the Care Act 2014. It enables the exchange of structured information between hospitals and social care organisations.

You can send:



hospital assessment notices to inform social services that an assessment of a patient's care and support needs is required

hospital discharge notices to confirm a patient's proposed discharge date

withdrawal notices to withdraw a previous assessment or discharge notice



You can also send an admissions notice with this integration so a hospital can inform social services that a patient has been admitted.

This is a messaging integration which uses MESH to send and receive messages.

Information Standard SCCI2075 defines the minimum data sets that you must use for Assessment, Discharge and Withdrawal (ADW) notices. For additional message guidance on the implementation and use of ADW FHIR messages and some divergences from this ADW Information Standard, see Assessment Discharge and Withdrawal - FHIR API.

get a specific referral

get referrals for a patient

get slots

 The following describes the end-to-end process: 

Send a request from your sender application to this API, along with a service identifier header.

This API redirects the request to the service associated with the service identifier header.

The target backend handles the request and sends a response back to this API.

This API returns the response to your sender application.

In some Applications the target may send a follow up request to indicate the outcome of a request.

Use this messaging integration to receive bowel cancer screening test results in primary care GP systems from the screening system, specifically faecal occult blood test (FOBT) results.

This integration uses UN/EDIFACT based messages sent over MESH.

Also known as NHS004 messages, these are a simpler version of the NHS003 messages specified in the Pathology EDIFACT v1.003 Standard but with the changes specified in 'Electronic GP Communication Requirements for GPSoC Software Suppliers Draft', under 'Additional guidance' below.

Bowel cancer screening NHS004 messages are almost the same as pathology NHS003 messages except they are much simpler in structure, with a single SNOMED code and 5 result values.

If you are building a system to receive bowel cancer screening test results, you can use our Lab Results adaptor to receive these EDIFACT results via an easy-to-use FHIR-compliant format.

Use this API to access Child Protection - Information Sharing (CP-IS), the national electronic database of child protection information.

The API can be used by local authorities and unscheduled care providers as follows:  



Local authorities

As a local authority, you can:



upload a patient's CP-IS information

receive a notification when the patient's CP-IS information is accessed from an unscheduled care setting

receive a notification of an inactive NHS number



Local authorities originally used a CP-IS client to transfer CP-IS data from their children’s social care systems to CP-IS via the Spine. This was replaced by the MESH client which all local authorities now use to exchange information with CP-IS - see connections 1 to 4 on the diagram.

Unscheduled care providers

As an unscheduled care provider, you can:



get a patient's CP-IS information - which automatically triggers a notification to the relevant local authority - see connections 5 and 6 on the diagram



Scheduled care providers

CP-IS is not currently available for use in scheduled care settings.

Information held in CP-IS

CP-IS holds the following information for each registered patient:



NHS number

details of their plan - type, start date and end date

details of the 25 most recent CP-IS information accesses from unscheduled care settings in England

the name of the responsible local authority - together with their office hours phone and emergency duty contact numbers



Identifying patients

All records in CP-IS are held against the patient's NHS number. It is therefore very important to ensure you use the correct NHS number for each patient.

For more details, see CP-IS NHS number matching information.

Using SCRa as an interim measure

We prefer unscheduled care providers to integrate their applications directly with CP-IS using our CP-IS APIs. However, as an interim measure, you can use our Summary Care Record application (SCRa) to access CP-IS information.

Spine Mini Service Provider (SMSP) options

There are also commercially available products which give easier access to CP-IS, known as Spine Mini Service Providers (SMSPs).

These and other conforming software products are listed in our Conformance Catalogue.

If you are interested in becoming a provider of one of these products, see Child Protection - Information Sharing - SMSP API standards.

Examples of these data registers include:



organisation codes

postcodes

diagnosis codes



You can see what data registers are available using our data registers tool.

If you're looking for richer functionality from a data source, such as being able to test data validity, extract a subset or map data across different schemas then take a look at our Terminology Server - FHIR API - the terminology server provides a richer view of the SNOMED data set only. This also conforms to the international FHIR standards for its APIs.

If your use case requires historical, point-in-time snapshots of reference data, they are available either from this API or the TRUD API. ",https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/data-registers-service-rest,,https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support,,,,nhs-digital

You can:



access the Identity Server which serves up SSO Tokens and manages the sessions for users who have been successfully authenticated

access the Identity Agent on the end user's workstation, which mediates the authentication transaction and serves subsequent user information on demand as part of the application's authorisation process

access the Client Signing Interface, which provides client-side digital signing functions for the purposes of Content Commitment. This interface primarily uses cryptographic functions that execute on a user’s smart card.



Users can only be authenticated if they are formally registered on the Spine. This includes creating a user profile, stored in the Spine Directory Service (SDS), containing the user’s roles and other information that the Registration Authority or Service deems necessary to make appropriate data access decisions.

This authentication service makes use of smartcards to provide strong authentication for health care workers to control access to national services. It is being replaced by NHS Care Identity Service 2 (NHS CIS2), which provides additional authentication methods for scenarios where a smartcard might not be preferred or appropriate.

 Accredited system records Every system that connects to the Spine has one or more “Accredited System” (AS) records in SDS, identified by an Accredited System Identifier (ASID).

This ASID is unique to a system deployed in a specific organisation, so the same application deployed into three NHS organisations would typically be represented as three unique ASIDs. MHS records and endpoints Every GP Connect system also has one or more “MHS” records (or message handling server record), identified by Party Key and Interaction ID.

MHS records of GP Connect provider systems contain the endpoint of the target practice, as defined by the FHIR service root URL.

Please see System topologies for more details on the allocation of ASIDs and Party Keys. 

For all intermediary messaging endpoint lookups, this API returns the NHS Digital Spine MHS endpoint address.

Use this integration to create and transmit documents containing Transfer of Care information following an outpatient consultation in a clinic.

An Outpatient Clinic Letter (also known as an ITK3 Outpatient Letter) is an ITK3 FHIR document containing Transfer of Care information from the hospital to the patient's GP and other relevant parties following a consultation in a clinic.

For example, a patient suffering from double vision is referred to an eye hospital and subsequently attends their outpatient appointment. Investigations indicate hypertropia, and the ophthalmologist recommends glasses fitted with prisms for treatment. The ophthalmologist completes and sends an Outpatient Clinic Letter to her GP.

This integration uses MESH to send and receive messages. It is part of a suite of Transfer of Care FHIR specifications.

Before you begin any development work using this integration, contact us to discuss your best options.

Use this API to submit 111 or 999 call triage data to us for quality monitoring purposes, following an NHS Pathways patient phone assessment.

As a 111 or 999 telephony provider's host system developer, you must submit triage data to us in real time following an NHS Pathways patient phone assessment. This is to comply with the Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) requirement of the Pathways licence agreement.

Providers and their regional commissioning groups can also log in to view this data using the Intelligent Data Tool (IDT) dashboard.

Because of the dashboard name, this API is sometimes referred to as the Intelligent Data Tool (IDT) web service.

You need a valid account to use this API to submit data. ",https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/urgent-and-emergency-care-continuous-quality-improvement-api,,https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support,,,,nhs-digital

Use these integrations to provide vaccination information to us at NHS Digital.

You can send us information relating to:



coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccinations

COVID-19 extended data attributes

COVID-19 hourly vaccination aggregate data for the NHS Foundry

seasonal flu vaccinations

measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccinations



These integrations specify the flow of vaccination-related information from healthcare settings including:





hospital hubs - NHS providers vaccinating on site 





local vaccine services – community or primary care led services which could include primary care facilities, retail, community facilities, temporary structures or roving teams 





vaccination centres – large sites such as sports and conference venues set up for high volumes of people 





These integrations use MESH to send and receive pipe-delimited (|) and not-sign-delimited (¬) files.

You can send us information on adverse reactions relating to: 



coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccinations.



This integration specifies the flow of information relating to vaccination-related adverse reactions from any healthcare setting including:





hospital hubs - NHS providers vaccinating on site 





local vaccine services – community or primary care led services which could include primary care facilities, retail, community facilities, temporary structures or roving teams 





vaccination centres – large sites such as sports and conference venues set up for high volumes of people 





This integration uses MESH to send pipe-delimited files to us.

Regulatory reporting

This information flow captures any adverse reactions which occur within the first fifteen minutes after administration of the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination. 

At NHS Digital, we must share this information with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Yellow Card scheme. This scheme is the UK system for collecting and monitoring information on suspected safety concerns or incidents involving medicines and medical devices, including vaccines. 

The information we share with MHRA as part of this scheme is anonymised.

Use this integration to publish or receive messages about changes to a patient's vaccination details, including:



new vaccinations

updated vaccination details

deleted vaccination details



This service currently covers childhood vaccinations up to the age of 19, and for direct care purposes only, in the context of Digital Child Health. If you'd like to use this API to publish or consume other vaccination types across all age groups, contact [email protected].

Using a publish-subscribe model, we share information about these events with healthcare workers in other organisations such as GPs, Emergency Departments and Local Authorities.

This integration uses a publish-subscribe model - the sending system publishes events to National Events Management Service (NEMS), and NEMS forwards the events to all subscribed systems via MESH.

For example, when a GP system records a vaccination, it sends an event message containing the vaccination details to NEMS. NEMS then sends the message to all healthcare workers who have subscribed to receive vaccination event messages.
