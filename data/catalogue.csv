This tariff entered into force on 1 January 2021. The UKGT applies to all goods imported into the UK. It lists preferential measures where the UK has entered into a new trade agreement or arrangement with a third country or territory. For other countries and territories, it shows the UK's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariffs. The dataset does not include other import duties (such as VAT) and details of quota volumes. This table (one of 3 available) shows all of the commodities that are part of the UK's goods classification and their English descriptions.\n\n Codes are organised in a hierarchy with each ""parent"" code having zero or more ""child"" codes that represent a more specific classification of the parent commodity. \n\nCommodities at all depths of the commodity hierarchy are included, but only commodities without any children codes are declarable. The current parent code of each commodity code is also listed and is accurate at the time the file was generated – note that parent codes can change over time. \n\nThe tariffs in this dataset may be a representation of future events and as such are subject to change. \n\nYou can use this data when you need to make a calculation against the new duties that apply in the UK.
