2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,Messaging Exchange for Social care and Health (MESH),"The Message Exchange for Social care and Health (MESH) component of the Spine allows messages and files to be delivered to registered recipients via a java client. Users register for a mailbox and install the client. The MESH client manages the sending of messages which users (typically user systems) have placed in an outbox directory on their machine.\nIt similarly manages the downloading of messages and files which other users have placed in the user's virtual inbox on the Spine. The MESH server has been designed with an underlying HTTP based protocol. This protocol is capable of being used directly where user systems wish to bypass the MESH client or where they want to construct their own clients. Thus the MESH service will become a direct 'store and retrieve' messaging mechanism between endpoints as a new asynchronous pattern for Spine consumers. MESH uses a RESTful paradigm and thus messages which are send via mesh are POSTed to a MESH virtual outbox and recipients retrieve messages through a GET to their virtual inbox. The following document summarises the MESH HTTP API which may be used by clients directly or over which other SOAP or other APIs may be overlaid.\nPlease note that the Production Server listed in the Console of this Apiary page refers to NHS Digital's Solution Assurance Integration test environment and not Live.

2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,National Record Locator - FHIR API,"There is currently no national solution for locating and sharing patient records across health and care systems. The National Record Locator (NRL) will enable an authorised clinician, care worker and/or administrator, in any health or care setting, to access a patient's information to support that patient's direct care. In turn, NRL will empower professionals, patients, and communities, strengthen primary, secondary, and acute care and introduce system efficiencies. This new national capability will aim to complement local digital initiatives (including Shared Care Records) and enhance the level of digital maturity across Health and Care. Phase 1 aims to demonstrate this capability, testing the concept of cross border interoperability and crucially enabling the power of local Shared Care Records (where they exist) to become woven into the NRL fabric from the outset.\nNHS Digital intends for the NRL to be accessible to all localities in 2019, opening up the possibility of achieving the 'holy grail of interoperability' in the months and years that follow. The NHS England Target Architecture also states that platforms moving forward will be expected to use common national services, standards, and governance processes to ensure national cohesion, including the NRL. More information can be found at the NHS England page on Interoperability.\nIn 2016, NHS Digital concluded a proof of concept project to test the implementation challenges of the NRL and to measure its potential service impact and benefits. A decision was made to continue with the development of the NRL in four key regions across the NHS identified for their digital maturity as outlined below. Working initially with urgent and emergency care, the NRL will enable cross border, cross organisation and cross sector interoperability. Our plan therefore is to integrate with:\n    North West, North East, Yorkshire, and London Ambulance Services and Mental Health Trusts\n    The Lancashire Patient Record Exchange Service\n    Cheshire Care Record\nProving the success of such integrations in Phase 1 will allow all records held within local shared records to be accessible via NRL in Phase 2 and beyond.",https://developer.nhs.uk/apis\nrl/,,,,,,national-health-service

It is written as a proprietary interface as defined in the following document. The tracker utilises a synchronous request / response pattern. It is synchronous with respect to HTTP connections which means that only a single HTTP connection is required to perform a complete request. Future interfaces on Spine2 are will tend towards this simple pattern wherever possible with the intention of eventually removing the need for asynchronous ebXML communications.\nThe prescription tracker provides a REST interface with two queries - prescription search and prescription retrieve - allowing querying to take place utilising a simple syntax.

2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,Urgent & Emergency Care Appointment Booking,"There is a demand for direct appointment booking capabilities across multiple Urgent and Emergency Care (UEC) services in England. This need stems from a strategic requirement to improve patient journeys and system efficiency. Therfore there is a need for a national standard that sets out what appointment booking solutions should and should not be able to do.\n\nUrgent and Emergency Care (UEC) has always been provided locally and things like the ability to book appointments and transfer care was dealt with locally or internally within a service, meaning they were often done using the same IT system. Local evolution of care systems gave rise to a largely heterogeneous IT infrastructure across the country.\n\nThe heterogeneous IT infrastructure is a blocker to directly booking appointments and transferring patient care between services and as such a capability gap exists.\n\nSome proprietary solutions have been created to provide a tactical solution for appointment booking interoperability between services. Nevertheless, there is a common list of issues and gaps that system suppliers and service providers have identified around these solutions. The biggest gaps are currently:\n\n    a lack of clearly defined appointment booking workflow that can be applied consistently across all services\n\n    a lack of an appointment registry / index that allows services to easily find out if a patient already has an appointment booked\n\n    a lack of business rules around how appointment booking should be handled when happening across regional borders (introduces financial, political, and accountability challenges).\n\nSystem suppliers and service providers alike have asked for standardisation of the appointment booking technical specification and workflow in urgent care.",https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/uec-appointments/,,,,,,national-health-service

Measurements of the amount of precipitation (mm) are captured in Tipping Bucket Raingauges (TBR). The data reported here gives accumulated totals for each 15 min period. The data is typically transferred once or twice per day.\n\nThe Rainfall API provides access to these rainfall measurements, and to information on the monitoring stations providing those measurements. It is compatible with (and integrated into) the API for water level/flow readings.\n\nNote that for information protection reasons the rainfall monitoring stations do not have names and their geographic location has been reduced to a 100m grid.\n\nThese APIs are provided as open data under the Open Government Licence with no requirement for registration.

It records tidal elevations at 44 locations around the UK coast. Data is made available in near real-time with measurements reported every 15 mins. The measurements provide mean sea level within each 15 min window and are reported both relative to local datum (unit m) and relative to the Ordnance Datum at Newlyn (unit mAOD).\n\nThe Tide Gauge API provides access to these measurements, and to information on the monitoring stations providing those measurements. It is compatible with (and integrated into) the API for water level/flow and rainfall readings. The API data is normally updated every 15 mins so typically the latest available reading will lag between 15 and 30 mins.\n\nNote that all times given by the API are in GMT (also known as UTC), as indicated by the Z suffix (see XML Schema datatypes).\n\nThese APIs are provided as open data under the Open Government Licence with no requirement for registration.

The API provides access to these asset description records along with information on maintenance activities planned for the assets. Only some assets have an associated maintenance schedule.\n\nIn the API the maintenance information is split in to three different types. Maintenance activities represent funded and scheduled work. A single activity may involve several maintenance actions on several different assets. We divide the activities into separate tasks, where each task represents a specific maintenance action on a single asset. Finally maintenance plans represent intended maintenance activities for future financial years but which have not necessarily been scheduled or funded at this stage. The API allows all activities, tasks and plans to be listed for a particular asset, set of assets or across all assets.\n\nPlease visit the [Defra Data Services Forum](https://support.environment.data.gov.uk/hc/en-gb) to let us know about any issues or to ask questions.",https://environment.data.gov.uk/asset-management/doc/reference,,,,,,environment-agency
